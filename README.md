This is a very simplified recreation of the arcade classic Bubble Bobble, made in Godot 4.0. I'm using assets from the book Code the Classics. The repo for these assets can be found here: https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Code-the-Classics
The book has code for the game in Python. However, I want to learn how to use Godot, so I'm making it in that instead.
